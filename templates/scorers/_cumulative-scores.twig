          <button type="button" class="px-2 bg-red-600 text-white text-2xl rounded-full">Â½</button>

          <p>
            If a player hits a Shanghai (a double, treble and single in the one number) any one of the remaining players
            <strong>must</strong> hit a Shanghai. Failure to do so results in an immediate win by the first player to hit a Shanghai.
          </p>
          <p>If a second player manages to hit a Shanghai all currently knocked-out players are back in and play continues from that point (players who were knocked-out start again from the current play, not from where they got knocked out).</p>

      {% endif %}
      <p>To score just put in the score the player hit for that round, the table will work out the running totals for you.</p>
